**To Compile:**
- Part2a: "gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -O0     src/part2a_101260631_101298706.c     -o bin/part2a -pthread"
- Part2b: "gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -O0     src/part2b_101260631_101298706.c     -o bin/part2b -pthread:

**To Run:**
- Part2a: "./bin/part2a 3"
- Part2b: "./bin/part2b 3"

**Tests:**

To simulate different tests, there are several factors you can adjust:
- the number of exams in /data/exams/
- the number of subjects or their grades in /data/rubric.txt
- the number of processes running concurrently (given in the input to run)

Test outputs from two thorough tests we ran have been committed to /data/
